            <h2 id="aboutme">About<br>Me</h2>      
             <p>I am a driven, professional individual eager to break into web development. 
                Currently working as a Payroll Systems Analyst where I got my first taste of programming. 
                I had been working in my company for five years in Operations and Finance when an opportunity arose to move into a systems role,
                I was officially hooked. This is where my love for computers, puzzle solving, and coding started. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Being the sole person in my 
                department to an 11 thousand employee large company meant I had to self-learn and learn quick! Developing live data, 
                large scale reports using various BI tools as well as SQL and PayGlobal builds. Three years on and my passion for learning 
                has not haltered. Wanting to take on a new challenge, I commenced a web developer and coding bootcamp with UWA. But enough 
                about me, take a look as some of the things I have been creating.</p>
